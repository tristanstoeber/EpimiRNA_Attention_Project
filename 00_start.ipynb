    "# Characterizing the Hidden Structure of Emerging Epilepsy with Transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "This plan uses a robust two-stage approach for deep learning on long-term EEG data, separating signal content (representation) from temporal dynamics (sequence).\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",

    "## 1. The Overall Two-Stage Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "| Stage | Goal | Task | Output |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **I. Representation Learning (Content)** | Learn a dense vector **embedding** for each 1-second EEG segment. | Self-supervised learning (SSL) to compress 512 data points into a **state vector** (e.g., 128D). | A sequence of embeddings: $\\left[\\text{emb}_1, \\text{emb}_2, \\dots, \\text{emb}_N\\right]$ |\n",
    "| **II. Sequence Modeling (Dynamics)** | Learn the temporal **rules** of how these states follow each other. | Causal Transformer predicts the next embedding from a sequence of past embeddings. | An interpretable **attention map** revealing predictive state transitions. |\n",

    "## 2. Stage I: Learning the 1-Second Embedding (SSL)\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to force the model to pack the essential \"brain state\" information into a small vector without using labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Method Options (Self-Supervised)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Contrastive Learning (SimCLR/CPC):**\n",
    "    * **Process:** Generate two augmented views (e.g., noise, time-warp) of the same segment.\n",
    "    * **Logic:** Maximizes the similarity between the embeddings of the two augmented views while minimizing similarity to all other segment embeddings in the batch.\n",
    "    * **Benefit:** Learns more robust, state-focused representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Stage II: The Transformer for Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to predict the future brain state based on the history of learned embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Architecture and Task\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Architecture:** **Causal Transformer** (e.g., GPT-style decoder).\n",
    "* **Input:** Sequence of past embeddings (e.g., $\\text{emb}_{t-120}$ to $\\text{emb}_{t-1}$).\n",
    "* **Output:** Prediction for the next embedding ($\\text{emb}_t$).\n",
    "* **Loss Function:** Minimizes the difference between predicted $\\text{emb}_t$ and actual $\\text{emb}_t$ (e.g., **Mean Squared Error**).\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Handling Long Contexts\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Standard Transformer:** Feasible for **minutes** of context (60-300 embeddings).\n",
    "* **Hours of Context:** Requires **Efficient Transformer** variants (e.g., Longformer, Performer) or **Hierarchical Embeddings** (e.g., averaging 60 one-second $\\text{emb}$ to create one-minute summary $\\text{emb}$).\n",

    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Key Interpretation: Interpreting Attention Maps üó∫Ô∏è\n",
    "\n",
    "The attention maps are the mechanism for discovering the temporal rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Cluster the Embeddings (Find the \"States\")\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Sampling:** Gather a large dataset of the learned 1-second embeddings.\n",
    "2.  **Clustering:** Apply an unsupervised algorithm (e.g., **k-means**) to group embeddings into distinct \"clusters\" (e.g., 50 clusters).\n",
    "3.  **Interpretation:** Manually inspect the raw EEG segments corresponding to each cluster to assign a meaning (e.g., \"delta-wave sleep,\" \"interictal spike,\" \"pre-seizure theta\"). These clusters represent the **data-driven brain states**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Analyze Attention Between Clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Target Prediction:** Select an instance where the transformer successfully predicts a key state (e.g., a \"spike burst,\" Cluster 27).\n",
    "2.  **Extract Attention:** Extract the **attention map** for this prediction. This map shows the weight the model gave to every single previous second ($\\text{emb}$) in the context window.\n",
    "3.  **Cross-Reference:** Check which **cluster** the highly-attended-to past seconds belong to. (e.g., If $\\text{emb}_{t-45}$ received 40% attention, and $\\text{emb}_{t-45}$ belongs to Cluster 42 (\"pre-seizure theta\")).\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Draw Conclusion (State-Transition Graph) üìà\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Result:** You discover a temporal rule: **\"State 42 is highly predictive of State 27 occurring $\\sim 45$ seconds later.\"**\n",
    "* **Synthesis:** Aggregate thousands of these findings to build a **weighted, directed state-transition graph**, where nodes are the brain states (clusters) and edges represent the predictive power (attention weight) between states at specific time lags.\n"
